# Badges to apply for
We would like to claim the Reusable and Available badges. We believe our artifact satisfies the following requirements, and thus deserves the badges we are applying for.
 - Functional: We use AutoTap to synthesize rules based on real-world user-written properties from our user study. AutoTap's ability of verifying existing rules against properties is also tested. Therefore, we believe our tool is functional.
 - Documented: We provide instructions and examples to set up and use AutoTap in README.md. We also provide a tutorial of AutoTap which we used in our user study. The result of the user study showed that novice users could easily use AutoTap with that tutorial.
 - Reuseable for re-purposing: We release our code and some of the data from the user study. Researchers in the same area could modify our code as well as to re-use our collected data from the user study.
 - Publicly available: Our tool is open-source and publicly available under GPLv3 license.

# Reasons to publish AutoTap
We wish to make our code and data publicly available because of the following reasons:
## This provides an intuition of AutoTap's technique.
We wish our web application could provide a sense of what AutoTap is doing. For example, from the web application, users can easily know what properties AutoTap handles, and what is the rule format.
## We want to provide data for researchers in the same area.
Getting trigger-actoin programs written by real end-users is hard. Trigger-action program for novice end-users is still in its early stage commercially. Most such programs available is from APP markets and is written by professional programmers. Moreover, it is hard to do field studies in people's smart homes because of privacy issues.

Our data contains TAP programs written by participants which is a valuable resource for researchers in this domain, and we would like to make those data available to reduce other reseachers' efforts of collecting data.
