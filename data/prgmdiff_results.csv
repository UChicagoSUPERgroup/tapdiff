I saw that program 2 had the desired functionality that the original program had, but did not satisfy the window requirement, so I then decided that program 2 would not be a replacement for the original program. ",The interface helped me make my decision easier. It was easy for me to pull up the 2 windows showing the patterns of the 2 programs to allow me to compare functionality and see if the second program lacked anything the original program did.,3,1,3,"Same set of steps here, I opened and read through the task instructions and made sure that I understood what it was asking me. From the problem, I knew that I had to make sure that the camera is always recording the house when Alice is asleep and the front door is unlocked. I found that in the modified program sometimes the camera does not record if Alice is sleeping but it does after checking so I thought that was a ok condition that met with the goal of the original program. I was a bit on the fence, but the other patterns in the modified program appearted to follow the constraints even though it may do other things like turn off the Roomba. ",The design of the interface made comparing the original program with the modified program fairly easy and I was able to come up with my solution because of it.,1,6,1,"For this problem, I read the task instructions carefully and made sure to for each pattern that if both Alice and bobby are home, the AC should turn on, else if neither are home the AC turns off. Right off the bat I saw a discrepancy in program 2 if Bobby exits the house and the AC is on the AC will turn off. But then I thought to myself what if Alice is home, then the AC will  turn off in that instance because Bobby left, and the rule doesn't check if Alice is home too. So I saw that that rule didn't take into consideration that Bobby can leave and the AC will turn off but Alice can be home also. With this in mind, I choose Program 1, which appeared to follow the restriction without violating anything.","Again, with the previous tasks, the interface made it very easy for me to have both program 1 and program 2 as well as the task open side by side so I can compare the patterns in each program with the instructions to see if I can find any violations.

I then read through the original program and made sure that it met the constraints specified in the instructions. I then went through program 1, and made sure that each instructions satisfied the constraint that only 1 window may be open at a time regardles of what window. I did the same for program 2 and found that both had it so only 1 window is open at a time. I then made my decision that both programs satisfyed the constraint of the instructions.",I felt that the interface kinda hindered my ability during this task. I had to open 4 tabs in order to do the task and arrange the tabs so I can see each clearly but once I had the tabs open and arranged it helped me answer the question quite confidently.,6,1,2,"For this task, I just had the instructions opened because opening 27 tabs is unpractical. I first read the instructions and made a note to myself that the SMART TV should never turn off and that Alice prefers fresh air over closing the window meaning that she would rather have the Roomba off than close her window in order to hear the TV.  With this in mind, I opened up each task one-by-one and saw if it it turned off the Roomba rather than close the window. If I saw any program that turned off the TV for any reason I skipped it and moved on. In the end, I couldn't finish within the 5 minute time frame so I just gave my best guess.",The interface was moderately helpful for me during the task. I just had one tab open with the instructions and another for each program. It made it fairly easy to check that each program satisfied the constraints.,3,1,3,"As always I first looked at the task instructions which told me that Alice would like to save energy in her home by never having all of the devices on at the same time which was the AC, coffee pot, HUE lights, smart TV speakers, and the Roomba. I then opened up program 1 and 2 in separate tabs and compared each statement. If at any time, I saw that any of the above devices were on at the same time, I skipped that instruction and moved onto the next one. This was very time consuming so I just took my best guess in the end.","The design of the interface helped me out a lot with this task. I had the task instructions open on one side, and both programs 1 and 2 open side-by-side so I can compare them to make sure they complied with the constraints. ","First, I would look at the top left and see a button ""labeled task instructions"" and click on that to open the instruction in a tab. I would spend about a minute or two reading each word carefully then I would size it so that it would fit on the far right of my screen. I would then use my mouse cursor on the drop down menu labeled ""programs"" and select program 1. I would then go take another 3 minutes reading each instruction in the program to make sure I understand it and once I am done, I do the comparisons to make sure the constraints are met. I would then pull the program 1 tab to the side and then select program 2 from the dropdown menu. I would use the scrolling interface to read each instruction within program 2 and compare each instruction. ONce I have found any contradictions within one or more of the programs I would then go down and select my options and press submit to move on with the survey.",I found it very useful that the interface was straightforward and easy to use. I liked that once I opened a tab I was able to adjust its height and width so that I can fit multiple tabs next to each other.,"What I found least useful about the interface was the section describing what ""+"" and ""-"" mean in regards to the programs. I felt it was redundant to have that show up every time I clicked in to do the task.","When I was doing the task, I personally found nothing about the interface that was particularly confusing but I would like to comment that on task 3 when I had to compare 27 programs the interface made it hard to do the comparisons.",1,"I never used the interface in the middle of the screen and I actually preferred clicking the ""programs"" buttons because it allowed me to pop the programs out into separate tabs which I liked a lot more than having the programs show up in the middle of the interface.

There was nothing to scroll between. There was just the Original and the ""Modified"" program, which was not actually modified. It was literally the same as the Original, so saying that it didn't actually fulfill Alice's needs was the obvious choice.",Not really applicable in this case. The programs were the same. It was easy to find out what the task was that Alice wanted to have happen and it was easy to see that this was not the case.,4,5,3,"While the program had been modified, near as I could tell, the goal was to make sure that the camera was still going to record even while Alice was asleep. Since both programs clearly indicated that this was the case, the modified program still technically worked.

I will admit, however, that my judgment was clouded a bit due to my annoyance with the friend in this situation. If someone went and modified programs to my house without me asking them to do so, I'd probably kick them out and never invite them back. I also might not speak to them again.","The design was very straightforward and easy to read, so in that case, it helped me.",2,6,4,"In this particular instance, we needed to make sure that the AC could be used freely, but that it would turn itself off if neither Alice or her brother were at home. After going back and forth between both programs, I realized very quickly that there wasn't a difference between them. Program #1 and #2 were the exact same program. I'm unsure if that was intentional or survey/programmer error, but given that both programs achieved the end goal, both suited the end goal and thus that was my answer.","It didn't really do either one? It did let me see both programs clearly and indicated the additions to the programs, but in this case, given that both programs were the same, I don't think it was really more helpful or harmful. It was just sort of there.",4,4,2,"The goal in this case was to make sure that only one window was open at any given time, but, again, near as I could tell, keep it as close to the Original Program as possible. After analyzing both of the programs, Program #1 had some details missing that would allow for multiple windows being open at once (which was not the end goal). Program #2, however, was the closest to the original program, with the addition of one window in particular NEVER being open while another window was open, which I'm not entirely sure was necessary, but it would ensure those two windows not being open at the same time. To my mind, that made it the safer bet.","The design of the interface was actually incredibly helpful. The color coding made it incredibly easy to figure out what the new additions in the programs were and whether or not they would be most useful.

Additionally, I went into the program tab separately so I could see what each program did individually. This was slightly less helpful to me as I found the color-coding to be more beneficial, but it was nice to see what each program would do clearly laid out in ""if/then"" statements.",4,3,5,"Given that the end goal was incredibly specific (prioritizing the open window while the Smart TV was on), I basically went through every program to make sure there was a notation to that particular effect (i.e.: the Roomba not turning on while the window was open and the TV was on).

There were a couple of programs that did mention the TV not being on while the Roomba was on and the window was open, but I mostly eliminated those as the TV and the open window were indicated to be priorities.","Browsing between all of the programs was actually more difficult than anticipated. I don't know if it was my browser specifically (Chrome on a 1920x1080 resolution) or just how the interface was designed, but I would get to a certain point where I would try to go to the next program in the drop down menu only to find it hidden by the top of my browser. Alternatively, when I was on Program #20 or so, the first program I could see in the drop down immediately after that was #22 or #23. I honestly think it would have been easier if I could have used my arrow keys to scroll through all of the programs as opposed to selecting them from a drop down menu.",2,6,4,"Given that the goal was to ensure that multiple devices were not on at the same time and Program #2 was the same as the original program (where nothing happened), selecting Program #1 was the easy choice as it specified that all of the listed devices wouldn't be on at the same time.",The interface neither helped nor hindered my ability to answer this question. There were only two programs and I could easily swap between them.,"First, I would ignore whatever was immediately displayed on the interface and click on the Task button. Then, I would read the task so I could understand what problem was trying to be solved or what question I was trying to answer. Once I had read the task, I would close that pop-up and return to the interface.

Then I would look at the program lists and look over at the right hand column to see if there were multiple programs to look through. If there were, then I would click on the drop down menu to navigate to the first program in the list. I would pause to read and compare that program to the Original Program and mentally make note of the differences between them, if any. If there were multiple programs in that menu, then I would repeat this step for as many programs as there were in the drop down.

If there were not multiple programs, I would just look at what was displayed on the screen and compare that.

After making my comparisons, if any, I would navigate to the bottom of the screen to make my selection to answer the question provided by clicking on the radio button (or circle) next to my choice and then click on Submit.",The Task button was probably the most helpful to me. It let me see very clearly what the problem was that the program was trying to solve and I could gauge very quickly whether the programs were actually solving them or not.,There was a separate button for Programs which would just outline every step that a program was going to accomplish that I almost never clicked on since it was mostly irrelevant to me.,"Probably the drop-down menu for the programs, but only if the task consisted of more than 5 programs. It was incredibly difficult to navigate between multiple programs in any sort of numerical order, and I found that sometimes I couldn't locate certain programs at all unless I tried to scroll around a bit.

For program #2, it had every condition that the original program that Alice had wanted had, except that the bedroom window will never open while bathroom window is open, which is basically irrelevant because all the other patterns in program #2 already fulfilled that, so this program should be identical to the original program.

I believe this to be the case because the program did not specify he would be allowed to change the A.C. when home, it only specified that it would turn off when he was not home. Since this system is automated this didn't necessarily give him control over the A.C, hence my choice.","The interface helped and it was easy to tell what the original program did and what the other options did, but there just wasn't enough variety in the rules to make a clear choice easily.",6,2,3,"I believe program 2 meets the requirements but with all the exception rules it became harder to determine if there would be a conflict in the program that would result in more than one window being open. Program 1 seemed to have a criteria that would end with 2 windows being open at the same time which was against the prime goal. I had a harder time arriving at a solid program for this one due to all the rules and wished there was a more clear way to see how each rule would interact with each other perhaps using a hierarchy system. Overall, I am not that confident with the answer I arrived at.","The interface was helpful to a degree, but with too much information and being a novice I was struggling to parse out the information in a way that was meaningful and in a way that would allow me to make an educated decision on the right program to meet Alice's needs.",3,3,2,"I first tried to meet the requirements of minimizing noise from the roomba while still keeping the window open for fresh air. Therefore, when the T.V. was on and the window was open the roomba would not be allowed to turn on.",The interface allowed me to compare and narrow down rules until I found programs that seemed to match the specifications.,3,3,2,"It seems the program that had a rule that stated to never have all of these on at the same time would be the clear choice here. While there are no exception rules, a simple ""do not allow all of these to be on at the same time"" rule should maintain that if all but one of these items were on that the final item would not allowed to be turned on. In theory this should meet Alice's goal for energy saving because her previous program did not have any always/never rules in place. I am uncertain how this would work without other rules that created exceptions  i.e. if coffee pot is on and lights are on, and etc, then roomba can not turn on, but it seems like it should generally do what is desired.","The interface was useful, simple, and allowing a quick comparison between the current program which had no always/never rules and the modified program which did.","First, I would open the task to see what was the main Goal for Alice. This would allow me to determine what I was looking for exactly in a program and if the original or modified programs would meet this criteria. To determine this I would next use the right drop down menu to compare programs to the original program and using the information such as the +/- and the colors if the rules were applicable. After doing this I might change the program on the left to compare two modified programs and determine how they fare against one-another. Finally, I would decide on a program or no program and click through with my choice.",I found it helpful to have the task laid out simply in a box I could move to reference as I worked through analyzing the programs. The functions of the programs which showed the +/- allowed me to tell at a glance changes in functions. I believe the ability to compare programs using the drop down menu was also helpful.,"Some of the more confusing programs had a lot of exceptions which maybe visually could have been presented in a more helpful manner. As a novice, if I was presented with too many rules that needed to be compared it became confusing to determine what was affecting what and what the general outcome would be. Perhaps a grouping system would have made that aspect of the interface more helpful. ","Sometimes there were many rules listed and parsing out the interactions between them would be the most confusing. One task also had so many programs that it was confusing navigating between them and comparing them in an efficient manner. Although, this was slight and overall the interface was fairly intuitive after a minor crash course on how to go about using it.",3,"I mainly used the interface for all of the tasks except one. It was easier to see the information in a digestible  way through the icons, +/- system, and the color coded system. I used the programs button one time when I seemed to have technical difficulties on one task comparing programs in the main interface.

The prompt to come to the conclusion allowed for me to be able to quickly select my answer. Through the fact that the program only needed to add one modification, which it successfully did, I was able to come to the answer rather quickly. ",The interface helped this time because it made it easy to notice the different modification that was being added to the program. ,3,1,3,"I was confused if the camera had to be on in the second program if neither the door was unlocked or Alice was asleep. I figured that this would be the difference that made the program function outside of the original program's parameters. I know that this being outside of the parameters could possibly lead to a different result, however, I figured the camera functioning outside of the requested parameters was enough to make the program different. ","It slightly helped my ability, however, the task instructions leave it up to obscurity to me to have a program function outside of the specifically stated requirements.

Neither program met this requirement. ",The interface this time was actually helpful. Because there was no explicit guarantee that Bobbie would be able to receive air conditioning. This was evident from the layout of the interface and being able to look through the end results quickly. The interface was probably the most functional through this iteration. ,2,1,3,"I flipped between each of the programs to see if the end result would be similar. It was demanding in part because the tasks were at length, listed in a way that was difficult to comprehend. I found myself flipping for each one I was reading and then finding a pattern with the outcome to come to the conclusion that I reached. This was a method that I somewhat believe gave me a correct response to the question. I created a repetition method of saying to myself the original open, open, close, close to find the correct outcome. ",It hindered me because it was rather lengthy to work through. If it was only a brief description of the necessary goal I could have gotten to a conclusion much faster. ,1,1,5,"At first, I was completely at a loss for how to ascertain a correct response for this. However, I made note, that the main overall request, was for the Roomba to turn off and take priority to have fresh air if there was combined noise. I believe I came to a correct result as I switched through all 27 programs, there was only one response that met this criteria. I arrived at this answer by focusing on the roomba first, and the window second. I think this led me to a place where I felt comfortable coming to a conclusion. ",There were way too many possibilities that I could choose from. This significantly increased the time it took for me to come to a conclusion. I feel as if this hindered my ability to come to a conclusion effectively. ,2,3,3,"My thought process was to use the task requirements as a check list. Neither program was able to meet the check list I created in my head. This in turn made the conclusion that I came to rather easy.

So it did meet the goal.","It hindered because it did not allow me to just see if only 1 window is left open.

I kept finding that the source program of comparison, which I initially thought met all the goals, actually had a mechanism of operation I was not aware of at first which, upon comparison with a different program, turns out the program I thought met all the goals, did NOT actually meet the goal, due to an unforeseen hidden element of the program that the interface didn't tell me about.  In order to complete the task I had to compare numerous programs many times because I could not 'see' all the functions of the program that bore on this task.
","The interface hid the program from view. I could not see all of its functions.

However, the interface made me look through all of the situations in program 1, over a dozen, to answer the question of whether a device was turned off.  This was a big hassle.","I clicked on Task Instructions to see the goal.  Then I looked at the red and green labeled 'differences' in the programs, to see what the modified program did.  Then I looked at the blue text at the top to understand how this fits into the task goal.  then i clicked on the dropdown box to compare programs.",The blue text telling me how this fits into the smart home functioning.,"The dropdown box, because I cannot compare multiple programs at a time, only 1 each.",The gray labels describing 'And This Happens'  and what the outcome is.

82,69,2020-08-17 18:48:23,2020-08-17 19:59:38,4274,1,5,7,Had to see the step by step of the original program as there was no always or never pattern of information. Making sure the only extra step was the faucet being turned off if it was on when Alice left the bathroom was the priority.,The interface just having patterns doesn't help with one addition like this. Not having that always or never pattern to go through you have to make sure you compare that the steps are actually correct.,3,2,6,"So the pattern that the security camera would be recording while the front door was unlocked and Alice was awake didn't seem to be in the interface patterns listed. So initially my thought was to click that the program didn't meet Alice's needs. Checking the steps of the modified program suggested otherwise. The pattern showed that it covered all the times Alice was asleep, which would cover overlaps in sleeping and the front door being unlocked. Ignoring all the steps involving the Roomba, the steps themselves showed a condition where it started recording while the front door was unlocked while Alice was awake while the pattern in the interface didn't mention this. Therefore, the modified program met the same needs.","Looking at the patterns it would seem like the camera only would turn on while Alice is asleep, but when you look at the individual steps there seems to be a condition where the camera would start recording while awake and the front door is unlocked as well. The interface was misleading.",1,6,2,The original program pattern stated that the AC would auto turn off when Alice was not at home. Both Program 1 and Program 2 just added Bobbie to the pattern which should allow his use when he's home and still have the energy saving Alice wants.,It's nice to be able to compare additions and removals to the original pattern on a separate line and not just trying to spot a difference in the same pattern. So like the addition of Bobbie was its own rule and not on the same line as compared to the original box.,1,3,2,So looked at the initial program to see what it had. Compared what had stayed from Original to Program 1. Noted that the addition of a condition in which a window would never close when another window was open would mean that 2 windows could potentially be open at the same time for long periods of time and ruled out program 1. Checked program 2 and it's addition of making another window not open when a specific window was already open ensures that more windows can't be open at the same time. It having the other rules from the Original Program as much as it did would ensure that it followed Alice's needs.,There were more patterns in each box this time which made it a little annoying to have to scroll up and down to compare differences.,3,2,3,"So checking the instructions, prioritizing the window being open needed to be taken into consideration. This led to me making sure that any program chosen would have the condition that if the living room window was open while the TV was on that the Roomba would never turn on. This prioritized the window being open over the Roomba. As long as that condition was met programs should have been fine. Also had to exclude the opposite of the window never being allowed to be opened when the Roomba was on.",It was nice being able to compare Program 5 to like Program 26 in case I forgot the exact patterns of any of the programs I'd chosen. It was also nice to be able to put a program on the left that I had already deemed correct to quickly compare other programs to make sure they had the essential parts.,2,3,6,"So the interface had no patterns for the Original Program or Program 2. Program 1 met the condition that not all of the appliances would be on at the same time. Checking the individual steps of the programs that did not have their patterns listed in the interface, they seemed somewhat similar and since Alice wasn't satisfied with the Original, Program 2 was also unlikely to fit her needs.",Not having any always or never patterns means you have to go through the individual steps of the program and have some knowledge of it or just recognize the similarities in the exact steps and hope that that's correct. It's frustrating to see that lack of the always or never rules and makes it feel like there's no program.,First I would look at the instructions for the task to see what goal Alice had for her program. Then I would check to see if the original program had met her needs or not. I would then compare the new potential programs to see if they had the same patterns as the original programs. If there were no always or never patterns in the program or I wanted to double check something I would then check the individual program steps to ensure it met needs. If there were too many options for programs I would just compare the patterns.,"Being able to see removed patterns or added patterns at a different slot from the original was very helpful. So for example, when the original program would have three steps with two steps that were the same and one removed from the changed program, the steps kept would be on the same line as the original but if a new step was added it would be the fourth slot of the interface instead of the removed pattern.",When there were no always or never patterns you had to go through the individual steps and wade through steps that may not have relevance.,I didn't find any of it particularly confusing.,2,The middle of the screen gave me a quick idea of the patterns I needed. Knowing what patterns I was looking for helped and knowing the patterns in the interface were relevant to my searching.

There was one rule in program 2 I wasn't all the way sure about since it only talked about 2 windows with the others mentioned 3 but since in the end only 1 window was left open I though it had to fall with the rules.,On this one I didn't have to use the program tab like in some of the others since just reading down the list of rules one at a time made it easier to see if the end result I was looking for was listed. ,1,3,2,I was looking though the programs that ended in the roomba always being turned off while she was watching tv and that also allowed the window to stay open since she prefers the fresh air.,This time since there was so many programs listed as i was going down the list in order I always had to scroll back up to get to the next number in line since the box would skip down the list of programs eash time which was very annoying.,3,1,1,I was checking the programs to see which one matched up with what the original program did.

I discovered that it fully met the previous requirements plus the extra requirement of turning off the faucet. In my estimation, it does exactly what Alice required. Therefore, it passed my checklist and could be used by Alice.",Only having an original plan and a modified plan made this task very easy. I felt that the design of the interface helped me out. I was quickly able to discover what I needed to know.,1,2,1,"I knew that Alice wanted her recording when sleeping or front door unlocked. Based on those two requirements, I looked at the modified list and saw if it would work. Based on fulfilling those requirements, the modified list worked as well as the original program. It would keep Alice safe and able to record her home.",I felt that it helped me quickly discover the necessary information that I needed to answer the question posed to me.,1,7,1,"When I looked at Program 1, I immediately noticed that it included Bobbie and Alice whenever mentioning the AC. Program 2 would turn off whenever only 1 person left without regard for the other person still being in the home. I knew that Alice would want a program that included staying on if one person left, but the other person was still there. At the same time, the program continued to do what Alice wanted it to do in the original program.",I felt that it allowed me to quickly look at the different options and discover the best one for Bobbie and Alice. It also helped that it didn't include 27 options like one of the earlier ones you had me complete. I already mentioned why that made the interface terrible.,3,1,5,"I noticed that Program 1 only had 6 if processes and could not reach all 9 of the processes stated in the original program. In Program 2, one of the processes went against what Alice wanted to have happen in the original program. After seeing that error, I immediately took Program 2 out of consideration. ",It was much easier due to only having 2 programs in addition to the original program to look at and discern if they were useful. ,2,1,3,"I knew that any answer that closed the window or turned off the television could not be the right answer. The right answer had to prioritize keeping on the television, keeping open the window and turning off the roomba. I could only find one answer out of the 27 that met these requirements. I therefore deduced that it had to be the only answer.",I hated the fact that I had to keep clicking on the interface and scrolling back to the next program to see if it worked.

I also hated that the interface wasn't designed so that I could press a button and quickly move to the next program. ,7,1,7,"The original program didn't seem to align with Program 1 or 2.

They didn't meet the desires that she had in the original program. ",The design of the interface wasn't the problem. It was the layout of Program 1 and 2 compared to the original program. It was kind of brain garbling seeing all of the different smart items and figuring out which one should be turned off.,"I would first click on the top left button to read what Alice wanted to accomplish.

93,80,2020-08-17 18:50:06,2020-08-17 20:11:51,4904,1,1,1,This one was much simpler. I simply compared the original to the modified program and then checked to see if the necessary addition had been made. The ordering differed but I do not believe that should matter to the program.,It helped since the programs used much simpler if/then statements but it would also be much easier if the programs were listed side by side rather than using a drop down method to compare. ,3,3,3,"This third task shared some of the difficulties of the first. I tried to look through each scenario to see if the variables of being asleep and door being unlocked coincided with the camera recording. I believe it did in the modified, but I cannot be sure. If each time Alice is asleep the camera turns on and each time the door is unlocked the camera turns on, then her desires are met. Yet, what gives me pause is whether I missed something or if it is possible that some variable isn't stated. Were all scenarios addressed and if some scenario is missing could the camera have been off?  ","It would have been easier if the ordering was done in a more straightforward way, such as grouping everything scenario of sleep/wake door locked/unlocked together and not so mixed. ",1,6,2,"I read through each scenario for each task, paying attention on who was home and if the ac was on or off depending on which of the parties was home or not home. The second program had the flaw that if Alice left while the AC was on the AC would turn off and another instruction set for Bobby. Yet, left out that if one leaves while the other is home, the AC should not turn off. ",It helped by not having too many variables per instruction so it was rather straight forward but it could have improved if the instructions were ordered with their like instructions. It sometimes skips for one kind of instruction to another then back again. It's not clean.,7,1,6,"I tried to work through each scenario to see that one window was open but I would quickly get confused if I had read about one scenario or another and start over. Again, I wish I had the time to write out each variable that could take place and then compare, but 5 minutes is not enough for that. ","As stated with some of the other tasks, when the scenarios are not grouped like with like, it is difficult to keep track of what is going on. Ex. All scenarios in which the bathroom window starts open should come first then all scenarios in which the bathroom window starts closed, etc. etc. Then one can satisfy that each of those scenarios are achieving the desired outcome before moving on.",2,6,7,"At first I was reading through all three scenarios but eventually started reading only the final ""then"" information for each program. If one of the undesirable outcomes were present that program would not work, so it was rather easy then to weed out all the programs that did not meet Alice's desires.","This was not mentally demanding or difficult but was incredibly tedious. The drop down required scrolling to get to the next program. An arrow to simply click next would work much better than a drop down. Yet, one should also be able to filter out program that turn the TV off or close the window rather than going through one program at a time. ",7,1,4,"What I found difficult was how many variables were listed and it was difficult for me to keep them all straight in my mind. It would have been easier if it was some sort of drop down where I could input if x is on/off, is y on/off but that may have only worked with simple scenarios. Honestly, every program, including the original seemed to do what Alice wanted, but that could not have been correct because in each scenario something was off... I think. I believe setting the task up would actually be easier to keep things straight than reading it after the fact. I tried to read through to check that something was off with ever variable, but with the stated time restraint, my mind kept forgetting and needing to start over.","The middle ""while"" section having so many variables made if difficult for me to keep track of everything that was going on.","First, I clicked on the ""Task Instructions"" on the upper left hand of my screen. I read what the task was and what Alice desired. Then I clicked on the X to get out of the instructions. Then I read through the original program and having done so, clicked on the drop down menu in the upper center of the screen to access other programs to read through.

Yet, the most helpful might have been the Task Instructions. I'm not sure that counts as interface though.

In the Modified Program the camera only recorded when Alice was asleep and therefore did not do the same task as the Original Program,The interface helped me quickly identify the differences between the two programs by indicating when the camera was off and the conditions that followed,1,5,3,"I came to this conclusion based on that when either person is home the A/C should be on and when they are both not there the A/C should be turned off.

I knew based on the instructions that the TV unless already off beforehand should always remain on and never be turned off by the roomba or the window opening.
