We would like you to be specific in describing what you did and the order of what you did. To show you the level of details we're looking for, here is how we would describe the process of accepting a friend request on Facebook (on a desktop web browser):


First, I would look at the top right corner to see if there was a red number on the Friend Request icon (or the ""icon with two people on it"" if I didn't know its name). If there was a red number, then I would click on the icon and look at the person's name. If the person was someone I wanted to have as a Facebook friend, then I would click on ""Confirm"".",description,text
